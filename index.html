          <div class="half-width">
            <p>And for the first time in your life you feel in your gut the precious unity
              of the earth and all the living things it supports. Along the margin of a
              bay: as earthmen, we may have taken another step into adulthood. astronauts
              will remain the explorers, the pioneers, the first to go back to moon and on
              to Mars. But a spring balance, for instance, in which the tension of the
              coil is independent of attraction, would have readily given the exact
              equivalent of the loss. I got a telescope. I was terrified by its fragile
              appearance. Boldly going where hundreds have gone before in orbit around Earth.</p>

            <p>And behold the height of the stars, how high they are! Such civilizations release
              detectable signals into space. Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain
              lurking on planet earth, but to spread out into space. That planet has a considerable
              but moderate atmosphere. The earth will become a holy land which will be visited by
              pilgrims from all quarters of the universe. There was the dark velvet of the sky,
              the blue halo of the earth and fast-moving lakes, rivers, fields and clouds clusters.
              This is the goal: to make available for life every place where life is possible.
              We'll go into orbit. We're floating here on the shoulders of giants..</p>
